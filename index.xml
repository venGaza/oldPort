      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a simple life form, exiled from your home planet and in search of a new place to call home. The ruling came fast. Your taste in music was deemed to be far too &amp;ldquo;out-there-man&amp;rdquo; for anyone to possibly associate with you anymore. You were given 60 revolutions of Xenon around Fir to leave and never return. Gather whatever possessions and leave. You find your parents music collection, oddly in it is a golden disc labelled &amp;ldquo;Property of NASA, if lost please return to: EVNJAKL 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway Mountain View California.&amp;rdquo; The music on the disc was uncovered a while back and was not very interesting. This weird language that said something about &amp;ldquo;Peace, love and rock and roll. Also we&amp;rsquo;re having a really cool party tonight, so for whoever is out there, bring a friend and come along! Co-ordinates enclosed.&amp;rdquo; On the back the words &amp;ldquo;Draft, do not distribute or load onto probe&amp;rdquo; written in big red letters. That could mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll go, since you have nowhere else to go. But you&amp;rsquo;ll be careful. You well know to learn all you can about alien beings before making contact. They could be hostile, or listen to boring music. Time is slipping away fast, you race aboard the nearest ObarPool Spaceship. But you&amp;rsquo;ve never driven one&amp;hellip; what next genius?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-enter-space-time-coordinates-misc&#34;&gt;Task: Enter Space-Time Coordinates (Misc)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok well done. The console is on. It&amp;rsquo;s asking for coordinates. Beating heavily on the console yields little results, but the only time anything changes on your display is when you put in numbers.. So what numbers are you going to go for?  You see the starship&amp;rsquo;s logs, but is there a manual? Or should you just keep beating the console?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gctf-2019-attachments/00c2a73eec8abb4afb9c3ef3a161b64b451446910535bfc0cc81c2b04aa132ed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Task Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and download the Task Files and navigate to the folder in your command line client (I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Linux). Using the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command, we&amp;rsquo;ll list out the files to determine what we have to work with. In this task, we are given two files: a .txt file and an executable binary.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-list-out-files-using-ls&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol1.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;List out files using ls&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    List out files using ls
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go ahead and check what is in the text file. We&amp;rsquo;ll use the &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; command to print out the contents of the text tile to the console. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be anything of note here.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-run-cat-output-of-logtxt&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol2.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Run CAT output of log.txt&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Run CAT output of log.txt
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will go ahead and execute the binary(If you do not have execute permission, run the following command &lt;code&gt;chmod +x&lt;/code&gt;). It looks like this binary is the menu interface for the spaceship. Incidentally, the CTF destination is redacted and we get an error message when we input coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-run-the-binary-file&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol3.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Run the binary file&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Run the binary file
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exit out of the program with &lt;code&gt;^c&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can brute force the flag out of the binary by running the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; command on the &lt;code&gt;./rand2&lt;/code&gt; binary. This technique allows us to parse out the plain text from a binary file. We see that there are plenty of plain text strings within this file, so we need a fast way to search through.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-run-strings&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol4.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Run strings&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Run strings
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, GREP will come to the rescue. We&amp;rsquo;ll pipe the output of strings into grep input using the following command &lt;code&gt;strings ./rand2 | grep flag&lt;/code&gt;. There is our flag!&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-grep-the-strings-output&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol5.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Grep the strings output&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://vengaza.github.io/img/googlectf2019/001invitation/sol5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Grep the strings output
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flag:  &lt;code&gt;CTF{welcome_to_googlectf}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having successfully figured out this &amp;ldquo;coordinate&amp;rdquo; problem. The ship lurches forward violently into space. This is one of the moments when you realize that some kind of thought or plan would have been good, but typically for you and how you found yourself in this situation, you didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much before acting. Only the stars themselves know where you&amp;rsquo;ll end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what seems like an eternity, or at least one full season of &amp;ldquo;Xenon&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Galactic Overlord&amp;rdquo; you arrive in a system of 9 planetary bodies, though one of them is exceptionally small. You nostalgically remember playing explodatoid with your friends and hunting down planets like this. But this small planet registers a hive of noise and activity on your ships automated scanners. There&amp;rsquo;s things there! Billions upon trillions of things, moving around, flying, swimming, sliding, falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest may be the insect-like creatures flying around this planet, uniformly. One has the words &amp;ldquo;Osmium Satellites&amp;rdquo; written on it. Maybe this is a starting point to get to know what&amp;rsquo;s ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-satellite-networking&#34;&gt;Task: Satellite (Networking)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placing your ship in range of the Osmiums, you begin to receive signals. Hoping that you are not detected, because it&amp;rsquo;s too late now, you figure that it may be worth finding out what these signals mean and what information might be &amp;ldquo;borrowed&amp;rdquo; from them. Can you hear me Captain Tim? Floating in your tin can there? Your tin can has a wire to ground control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find something to do that isn&amp;rsquo;t staring at the Blue Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blunderbussing your way through the decision making process, you figure that one is as good as the other and that further research into the importance of Work Life balance is of little interest to you. You&amp;rsquo;re the decider after all. You confidently use the credentials to access the &amp;ldquo;Home Computer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something called &amp;ldquo;desktop&amp;rdquo; presents itself, displaying a fascinating round and bumpy creature (much like yourself) labeled  &amp;ldquo;cauliflower 4 work - GAN post.&amp;rdquo;  Your 40 hearts skip a beat.  It looks somewhat like your neighbors on XiXaX3.   ..Ah XiXaX3&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;d spend summers there at the beach, an awkward kid from ObarPool on a family vacation, yearning, but without nerve, to talk to those cool sophisticated locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are these &amp;ldquo;Cauliflowers&amp;rdquo; earthlings? Not at all the unrelatable bipeds you imagined them to be.  Will they be at the party?  Hopefully SarahH has left some other work data on her home computer for you to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time coming for me to take the time to create a personal portfolio page. I have been putting this off for years because I was so focused on finding the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; layout but I have finally come to the conclusion this does not exist! It was time to just take a leap of faith and dive into completing the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I want to build this though? I have been using my Github repository as a makeshift portfolio and to be honest, it is not all that inspiring to share with others. Even with a fantastic README.md, Github is just plain boring to peruse. I needed a better way to show off my projects and accomplishments. I needed to create a portfolio that people wanted to explore and make it easy for them to learn about me. I also figured this could be an opportunity to share a piece of myself with the world. A chance to share the knowledge I have come across from studying, reading, and building. Who knows, maybe this will inspire someone else&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TreasureHunt</title>
      <link>https://vengaza.github.io/project/treasurehunt/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 16:08:53 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first foray into the world of UI/UX design and I have to say it was very rewarding. It was refreshing to to approach the project from the design perspective and experiment with various tools to create high fidelity mockups. The project was created using Adobe XD and the project link is active if you want to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that ignites our inner imagination like the word treasure. Many people grow up watching, listening, and reading fantastic tales of treasure hunting expeditions which lead to unimaginable wealth or power. The real allure of these adventures tends to reside in the journey to the treasure rather than just the treasure itself. The proverbial “thrill of the hunt” keeps both treasure seekers and observers alike engaged by playing on the inquisitiveness and curiosity of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, In a world that has become increasingly connected through technological advances, it may sometimes feel as if there are no treasures left to discover and no more swashbuckling adventures to be had. TreasureHunt aims to defeat this notion by bringing people of all ages together to adventure once again. This application creates a significant usability problem because it must find a way to capture the magic of a treasure hunting experience and deliver it as a mobile application. The feeling of wonder and excitement is a fragile one, though, and can easily be lost to frustration with unintuitive UI elements and feelings of inability to continue exploring. We will work with diverse users and iterate based on the surveys we create to ensure our user experience is not sullied or cut short by frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Awards play a critical role in recognizing employee accomplishments and boosting morale within an organization but most systems are out of date or too reliant upon an extensive human resources staff. The Ukdah team aims to solve this problem by working on a database-backed, responsive website which can be used to track and deliver employee recognition awards. The website will streamline the recognition process by giving users the ability to send recognition to those that they feel are deserving, and it will also provide critical business intelligence data to users overseeing the management of their awards program. Every employee deserves to be recognized for the value he/she brings to their respective organizations while organizations deserve a simple and effective solution to accomplish this. The Ukdah employee recognition website will lead the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User Perspective: The users of this website will be employees of larger enterprise organizations who are having trouble managing their awards recognition process. These users can be split into two groups which include basic users who are authorized to give out rewards and admin users who serve in a managerial role to oversee the awards program for their entire enterprise. Both users will first encounter an authentication process where they will have to sign into an account, or create one if they have not done so yet. Basic users will need to submit a signature image in order to complete their account sign up since the signature will need to be used for their certificates. The authentication system will also feature a forgotten password recovery process which will email users a forgotten password to the registered email address. Once logged in, a basic user will have the ability to create an award. This will require the user to enter some basic information about the employee being generated and then the system will generate the certificate and email it to the awardee in a PDF format. Basic users will be able to see all the certificates they have awarded and will be able to delete them if they change their mind. When an admin user log in, they will not have the ability to create any awards. Instead, they will be presented with various data statistics in regards to the awards such as amounts, regions, and awarders. The admin user will also have the ability to add/edit/delete both other admin users and basic users.&lt;/p&gt;
