I had no clue what career I wanted to pursue after finishing college, but I did know that I wanted to live a life of adventure! Luckily, my path led me into the military where I had the opportunity to travel all over the world to lead various healthcare teams and hone my leadership ability. More importantly though it gave me time to reflect on what I wanted to do in life. I eventually realized it was time to hang up the boots and head out for my next adventure.\nI decided to go back to school and learn how to program because tech was something that had always fascinated me. I remember coming across various articles on TechCrunch and being so envious of the projects being funded. These were people who saw problems that could be solved by leveraging technology. These were people who were trying to redefine the status quo. These were people who were busy building the future and I wanted to be one of them! I wanted to learn how to build and turn ideas into reality.\nAs a new software engineer, I would very much describe myself as a generalist with an interest in machine learning, distributed systems, and security. My primary programming languages would be Python and Java, but I am fairly comfortable in C++ and JavaScript as well. If I had to choose between being a backend engineer and frontend engineer, I\u0026rsquo;d probably choose the backend since I like to tinker with the server and database. Ideally, I\u0026rsquo;m just looking to join an ambitious team working to solve complex problems with innovative solutions. If you have an opening, let\u0026rsquo;s definitely chat and see if their is a fit. I\u0026rsquo;m also always open to discussing the military or tech (like the nuances of read committed isolation vs snapshot isolation) as well so don\u0026rsquo;t be a stranger.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://vengaza.github.io/author/dustin-jones/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dustin-jones/","section":"authors","summary":"Sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you want until you just do.

The top 10 teams from the qualification round will be invited to the finals to compete onsite for a prize pool of more than USD $31,337. In addition to the grand prizes, some of the best and creative write-ups that we receive during the qualifying round will be rewarded as well.

All tasks will become available immediately once the Challenge goes live and can be solved in any order, though there may be some dependencies between tasks. The point value associated with each task is based on relative difficulty and schools will be ranked according to the total number of points accumulated by their students. It is still recommended to solve tasks in order since the tasks flow with the storyline, but that is not a requirement. Solutions may be submitted at any time for the duration of the Challenge. Good luck!\nBackground DISCLAIMER - The following is a FICTITIOUS story meant for providing realistic context for the Codebreaker Challenge and is not tied in any way to actual events.\nTech savvy terrorists have developed a new suite of communication tools to use for attack planning purposes. Their most recent creation — TerrorTime — is a secure mobile chat application that runs on Android devices. This program is of particular interest since recent intelligence suggests the majority of their communications are happening via this app. Your mission is to reverse-engineer and develop new exploitation capabilities to help discover and thwart future attacks before they happen. There are 7 tasks of increasing difficulty that you will be working through as part of this challenge. Ultimately, you will be developing capabilities that will enable the following:\nSpoof TerrorTime messages Masquerade (i.e., authenticate) as TerrorTime users without knowledge of their credentials Decrypt TerrorTime chat messages The first three tasks of the challenge will provide you with everything you need to install and run TerrorTime in an Android emulator. You will also discover account information for two TerrorTime users, which will enable you to send chat messages between the users by running the app in two emulators. Beginning with Task 4, the difficulty will increase significantly as you begin working towards the goals outlined above. We hope you enjoy the challenge!\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"9d2b88ffbc7c03f21cd7f3f2bd72896e","permalink":"https://vengaza.github.io/ctf/nsacodebreaker2019/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ctf/nsacodebreaker2019/","section":"ctf","summary":"The 2019 Codebreaker Challenge consists of a series of tasks that are worth a varying amount of points based upon their difficulty.","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"You are a simple life form, exiled from your home planet and in search of a new place to call home.

Many people grow up watching, listening, and reading fantastic tales of treasure hunting expeditions which lead to unimaginable wealth or power. The real allure of these adventures tends to reside in the journey to the treasure rather than just the treasure itself. The proverbial “thrill of the hunt” keeps both treasure seekers and observers alike engaged by playing on the inquisitiveness and curiosity of human nature.\nHowever, In a world that has become increasingly connected through technological advances, it may sometimes feel as if there are no treasures left to discover and no more swashbuckling adventures to be had. TreasureHunt aims to defeat this notion by bringing people of all ages together to adventure once again. This application creates a significant usability problem because it must find a way to capture the magic of a treasure hunting experience and deliver it as a mobile application. The feeling of wonder and excitement is a fragile one, though, and can easily be lost to frustration with unintuitive UI elements and feelings of inability to continue exploring. We will work with diverse users and iterate based on the surveys we create to ensure our user experience is not sullied or cut short by frustration.\n","date":1590527333,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590527333,"objectID":"da987a8df50f2ad9835779ea7adca639","permalink":"https://vengaza.github.io/project/treasurehunt/","publishdate":"2020-05-26T16:08:53-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/treasurehunt/","section":"project","summary":"My first foray into building a high fidelity mockup for a treasure hunting mobile application with Adobe XD.

The Ukdah team aims to solve this problem by working on a database-backed, responsive website which can be used to track and deliver employee recognition awards. The website will streamline the recognition process by giving users the ability to send recognition to those that they feel are deserving, and it will also provide critical business intelligence data to users overseeing the management of their awards program. Every employee deserves to be recognized for the value he/she brings to their respective organizations while organizations deserve a simple and effective solution to accomplish this. The Ukdah employee recognition website will lead the way!\nUser Perspective: The users of this website will be employees of larger enterprise organizations who are having trouble managing their awards recognition process. These users can be split into two groups which include basic users who are authorized to give out rewards and admin users who serve in a managerial role to oversee the awards program for their entire enterprise. Both users will first encounter an authentication process where they will have to sign into an account, or create one if they have not done so yet. Basic users will need to submit a signature image in order to complete their account sign up since the signature will need to be used for their certificates. The authentication system will also feature a forgotten password recovery process which will email users a forgotten password to the registered email address. Once logged in, a basic user will have the ability to create an award. This will require the user to enter some basic information about the employee being generated and then the system will generate the certificate and email it to the awardee in a PDF format. Basic users will be able to see all the certificates they have awarded and will be able to delete them if they change their mind. When an admin user log in, they will not have the ability to create any awards. Instead, they will be presented with various data statistics in regards to the awards such as amounts, regions, and awarders. The admin user will also have the ability to add/edit/delete both other admin users and basic users.\n","date":1555886145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555886145,"objectID":"1506df6b7172f1887c629a56af52c7aa","permalink":"https://vengaza.github.io/project/ukdah/","publishdate":"2019-04-21T17:35:45-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/ukdah/","section":"project","summary":"Full-Stack PDF certificate generator built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and SQLite for capstone","tags":["Full Stack"],"title":"Ukdah","type":"project"}]
